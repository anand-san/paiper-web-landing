    In a world drowning in paperwork, we saw a need for change. Paiper was born
    from a simple idea: what if managing documents could be as easy as chatting
    with a friend?
  </p>
  <p>
    Founded in 2024, Paiper is the brainchild of a team of document management
    experts, AI enthusiasts, and user experience designers. We've experienced
    firsthand the frustration of lost receipts, misplaced contracts, and the
    endless hours spent organizing paperwork. We knew there had to be a better
    way.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
